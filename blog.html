                   <hr>
                 Evaluate Noah’s use of humor to explain various instances in his life<br>
                 throughoutthe book. Discuss the overall impact of using humor, focusing on how humor enabled<br>
                 him to make friends and to get out of difficult situations. In this discussion,<br>
                 pinpoint certain words and phrases Noah uses to support the analysis of the use of humor<br>.
                 This book born a crime is a good book to read, It not only Trevor Noah this book <br>
                 enabled to make friends but also can help anyone  apart from him. According to chapter<br>
                 four ,page 52 shows the funny thing where he was playing with his cousin as a doctor<br>
                 and her was a patient where he was operating in her Bulelwa’s ear with a set of matches<br>
                 suddenly entered in her eardrum .Both were crying but his grandmother refused to punish<br>
                 him and said ”I don’t know how to hit white children because if you hit them they become <br>
                 colored but for black one   I do”.For  sure this was fun.<br>

                 In one million people lived in Soweto .Most were black,he was famous in his neighbourhood<br>
                 just because of his skin.whenever the kids saw him they would cry and  be surprised <br>.
                 Trevor was clever and genius in the sense that he always followed the words of his mom <br>
                 because when he was attending a private catholic school called Maryvale  collage on page 10.<br> 
                 He was the champion of the Maryvale sports and her mother won the mom’s trophy as him every<br>
                 single year, this is because she was always trailing  him to knock his ass. This enabled<br>
                 him to make friends and get out of difficult situations.<br>
                 Other thing  that empowered him to make friend is that his mother was a friend a woman who <br>
                 was his skin color and the woman was different race and woman would act as his mother ,Trevor<br>
                 allowed her without complaining.The other side Noah credited his mother for <br>
                 getting through the worst of time .She said” I can’t promise you money .I can’t<br>
                 promise you good life but I can promise you good knowledge and food”.<br>
                 These enabled him to get out of difficult situations.

                       Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever<br>
                       married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If <br>
                       he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for<br>
                       that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be <br>
                       subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women.<br>
                       “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream<br>
                       is to put her in a cage. Trevor Noah in Born a Crime.<br>

                       Abel was a stepfather to Trevor Noah. He was a mechanic and right around Trevor's father's house in <br>
                       Yeoville ,there was a garage called Mighty Mechanics where they always  took their car to be repaired.<br>
                       This is where Patricia met with this cool guy.<br>
                       Trevor Noah was six years by then. The guy was tall,lanky and lean but strong.Trevor’s mother loved Abel<br>
                       because he was a kind of person who loves helping people and he was handsome to the extent that Patricia<br>
                       used to say that there  is a type  of ugly that women find attractive.

                       She decided to get married with him but Trevor disagreed with her because Trevor Noah never trusted<br>
                       Abel and he consider him to be a bad person according to his Tsong name .He was a drank.So Abel wanted a<br>
                        traditional marriage with a traditional wife because the black  girls  in Tzaneen were being raised for<br>
                        marriage and men  wanted them to be subservient and he aexpectred Trevor's mother <br>,
                        but Patricia didn’t refuse to marry him.
                        After he started to hit Patricia for no reason, and shouting came in. <br>
                        For me this was tiresome because you <br>
                        can't marry a woman for subservient, being useful as if is not a human being.<br>
                        Abel would have empathy and recognize humanity to  Trevor’s family, on the other hand,<br>
                        this does not make sense because everyone must have respect for others and treat them equally.
